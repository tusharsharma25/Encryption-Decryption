C++ Encryption/Decryption Program
==========
You can take reference of this program in your C++ project.


How it Works
==========
The Encryption and Decryption is done by Letter Shifting Method. 

For example:

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]\\[

When the shift value is +3 the value of A will be D and so on. And the decryption is also on the similar basis.

The default password for the encryption is 111 and that for decryption is 000. You can change this value in the code from main.cpp file.

Similarly You can also change the shifting key to encryption.
